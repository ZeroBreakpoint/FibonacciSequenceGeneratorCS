# FibonacciSequenceGeneratorCS

A simple yet cleanly structured C# console application that calculates and prints the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, starting from (0, 1).

I developed this project as part of a coding exercise to demonstrate:
- Fundamental loop and variable manipulation
- Clean input validation and user interaction
- Logical problem-solving using iterative algorithms

## About the Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones:

##  Program Features

- Prompts the user for an integer `n`, indicating how many Fibonacci numbers to generate.
- Uses a loop-based approach to efficiently compute the sequence.
- Handles invalid input gracefully with error messaging.
- Outputs all results to the console in a single line.

## Technologies

- Language: C#
- Framework: .NET Core / .NET 6+
- Console Application
